# Weather-App

#### A simple Weather Forecasting API, that take address from user for any location and provide them current weather deatails of that location. Like Temprature, Latitude, Longitude and Precipitation Probability.... 

Also I have deployed my app with Heroku, So Wanna see my app just visit [**_FORECASTER_**](http://pawan-weather-application.herokuapp.com/) :sunglasses:

> Well,The front-end that you would be looking would not be that much good :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: as because this app is mainly for backend purpose as an Weather API but yes, that was my simple experiment and also feel free to contribute in this repo if you find any bug in it or wanna make my app more *sexy*. ðŸ¤™
