# Weather-App

#### A simple Weather Forecasting API, that take address from user for any location and provide them current weather deatails of that location. Like Temprature, Latitude, Longitude and Precipitation Probability.... 

Also I have deployed my app with Heroku, So Wanna see my app just visit [**_FORECASTER_**](http://pawan-weather-application.herokuapp.com/) :sunglasses:

**Note** If you are visiting it on mobile or small devices go for desktop mode bcz I haven't bootstraped those breakpoints :sweat_smile:

> Well,The front-end that you would be looking would not be that much good :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:, but that was my simple experiment and yes feel free to contribute in this repo if you find any bug in it or wanna make my app more *sexy* ðŸ¤™
